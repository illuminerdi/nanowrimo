Some interesting methods for parsing xml, will use nokogiri, since rails site will probably use mechanize, unless I decide to make the gem handle finding writing buddies.

must remember this - when creating a subdir in lib for new classes in your gem, the Rakefile needs to be told to look in the ./lib folder as a starting point.

FakeWeb seems to be a better solution than FlexMock for mocking up network calls.

FakeWeb is throwing the following set of errors when running tests with warnings:
/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/fakeweb-1.2.2/lib/fake_web/ext/net_http.rb:8: warning: method redefined; discarding old initialize
/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/fakeweb-1.2.2/lib/fake_web/ext/net_http.rb:28: warning: redefine socket_type

If I insert the following line above line 8 of that net_http.rb in fakeweb, the warnings go away:
alias :old_initialize :initialize

I should probably submit this as a patch, since warnings are annoying.
